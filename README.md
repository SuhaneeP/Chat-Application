# Chat-Application
A social media platform which would facilitate the user to create profile, develop social network via making friends and enjoy chatting with them. All the messaging and user related data would be stored in a database and accessed through it as per user demand. It uses Java Swing in frontend and oracle database in backend to store information. Our simple idea is to store and retrieve the messages and other data by executing appropriate queries which would then fetch the required data from tables stored in our database (in Oracle) and display the results.

Since its a DBMS projects, multiple procedures and functions were written in oracle to perform actions and increase functionalities. Also, various triggers were implmented for proper validations. All the details of procedures, functions and triggers are there in Report.pdf
